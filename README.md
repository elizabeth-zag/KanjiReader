Kanji Reader is an application for Japanese learners who already know some kanji and want to find texts that contain the characters they’ve learned. It addresses a common problem when reading Japanese: most texts contain too many unknown kanji. The app provides reading material based on your personal set of known kanji, making it much easier to start reading Japanese texts.
