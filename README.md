Kanji Reader is an application for Japanese learners who already know some kanji and want to find texts that contain the characters they’ve learned. It addresses a common problem when reading Japanese: most texts contain too many unknown kanji. The app provides reading material based on your personal set of known kanji, making it much easier to start reading Japanese texts.
Development plans:
- Add furigana and translations for texts;
- Add more sources for texts and store them in the app storage for persistence;
- Add light theme and overall design improvement;
- TBA
